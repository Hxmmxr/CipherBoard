### âœ… Next Steps You Can Take:

- Drop in a `preview.gif` or `screenshot.png` for visuals.
- Add a `favicon.ico` + terminal-style ASCII logo (`<pre>` style).
- Setup GitHub Pages for instant live demo.
- Bundle as a **PWA** (Progressive Web App) for offline install on desktop/mobile.
- (Optional) Convert to an Electron app for desktop packaging.

Let me know if you'd like:
- A matching `index.html` homepage with grid-style UI links
- A brand identity starter kit (colors, nameplate, logo, favicon)
- A one-click deploy setup (Netlify, GitHub Pages, ZIP bundle, or Electron)  
- PWA version to make it installable offline

Youâ€™re already very close to having a distributable digital privacy utility. Want to take it there?
